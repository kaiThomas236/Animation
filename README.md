CSCI Computer Animation


worked alone to model a large interior area. I decided to model the extravagant bathroom and foyer of a huge house.
the video is about 90 seconds long and can be found at https://youtu.be/wkKOYa4cFSo
to complete this project I mastered an entirely new software and learned a new skill set with almost no help from my rather technology inept professor.
there are a few errors in this project but my machine doesn't have the power to sit and render it again without me being unable to use it.
despite the errors I'm really proud of this project and the amount I learned to finish it.
